## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-File Upload**: Process and query multiple documents in formats like PDF, TXT, CSV, and DOCX.
- **AI-Powered Chat**: Ask natural language questions, and the bot retrieves accurate answers from document content.
- **Document Summarization**: Summarizes content for better context understanding.
- **Prompt Refinement**: Refines user questions for more precise responses. You can **enable or disable** this feature via the toggle, allowing you to improve prompt clarity and conciseness when enabled.
- **Memory Retention**: Tracks conversation history for maintaining context.
- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit-powered interface for intuitive interactions.
- **Extensibility**: Easily customizable for additional document types and use cases.

## 📋 Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Python 3.8+**: The version is automatically managed in the `setup.sh` script.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `pyproject.toml` and installed automatically using the `setup.sh` script with the `uv sync` command.
- **UV**: Install via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

   For more details, visit the [UV documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/uv/).

- **Python-dotenv**: For managing environment variables. Install via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv
   ```

   Add your API keys to a `.env` file in this format:

   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here
   ```

- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for GPT-4o mini and embedding models.
- **Hugging Face API Key**: Used to interact with Hugging Face's `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model for text summarization when the local summarizer model fails to load.
- **Bash**: Available on Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS). Windows users can use Git Bash or WSL.
